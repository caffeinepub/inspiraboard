  "summary": "The diff adds a Motoko backend with profiles, posts, tags, and (partial) messaging types/storage, plus a React+TS frontend with Internet Identity login, feed/post components, discovery UI, messaging thread polling, and basic call UI scaffolding. However, key parts of calling signaling (backend + real polling) and some required UI/assets evidence (empty feed illustration, conversation list data fetching) are missing or only stubbed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Conversation list that shows recent conversations and latest message preview, backed by persisted backend data and refreshed via polling.",
      "reason": "UI component `ConversationList` exists but there is no evidence of a backend method/hook to fetch a conversation list (e.g., getConversations) or any React Query hook for it; only per-user message history fetching (`useGetMessages`) is shown. Without a conversation-list query, the AC for recent conversations + preview is not demonstrated.",

      "requirement": "1:1 voice/video calling using WebRTC with canister-mediated signaling via non-WebSocket patterns (e.g., polling), including incoming prompt, accept/decline, in-call controls, and stable termination state.",
      "reason": "Frontend call signaling polling is explicitly a placeholder and does not poll the backend; WebRTC hook also notes it is not doing real peer connection/signaling exchange. There is no evidence in the backend diff of call signaling endpoints/storage to exchange SDP/ICE via polling.",

      "reason": "The diff shows an empty-state illustration for messages (`empty-messages...`) and the logo usage, but there is no evidence of rendering `empty-feed.dim_1200x800.png` anywhere in the shown frontend files.",
